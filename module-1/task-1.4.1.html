<p>In today's session we leant a little bit more about <a href="https://github.com">Github.</a></p>

<p>
The advantages of using Github are many. <br>
<br>

It allows you to:
<ul>

    <li>Create branches to develop features</li>
    <li>Identify when bugs are introduced to your code</li>
    <li>Revert back to previous versions of the code</li>
    <li>Have multiple developers working on separate features simultaneously</li>
    <li>Update only the parts of the code that you have changed so others' work isn't affected</li>
    <li>Monitor the development and manage the project</li>
</ul>
