        This sentance is contained within a paragraph tag.

        I was asked to take a test on W3Schools. I have taken a screen shot of my results and inserted it below. It's not a perfect score, but it's close.

        These are the questions I got wrong even though I used google to find answers to the difficult ones. Why remember stuff when you can look it up, right?

        Here's the info nobody reads that's usually quite helpful. Not many people get down into the footer. The css has made the footer background colour light pink.
