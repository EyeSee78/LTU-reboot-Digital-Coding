    <h1>
        We have learnt about opening and closing tags. This sentance is contained within an h1 tag but the css has made it extra small and blue! 
    </h1>
    <p>
        This sentance is contained within a paragraph tag. 
        <em> This sentance has been emphasised and is nested within this paragraph. The css has made it orangered. Come on which is it? Orange or Red?</em>
            <ul>
                <li>This is an unordered list</li>
                <li>It produces bullet points</li>
                <li>This is also nested in the paragraph</li>
                <li>Indenting nested elements</li>
                <li>Means it is easier to identify closing tags</li>
                <li>In your code</li>
            </ul>
            <oL>
                <li>This is an ordered list</li>
                <li>It produces numbers</li>
                <li>So that everything within</li>
                <li>Is given a level of importance</li>
                <li>This too is nested</li>
                <li>Within the paragraph element</li>
            </oL>
    </p>
    <div>
        <p>
            <strong>This is a strong element. It is nested within a paragraph element within a div element. You'll have to inspect my code for proof, though the css changes the text colour to darkred if it's in a div tag.</strong>

        I was asked to take a test on W3Schools. I have taken a screen shot of my results and inserted it below. It's not a perfect score, but it's close.

        These are the questions I got wrong even though I used google to find answers to the difficult ones. Why remember stuff when you can look it up, right?

    <h2>We also learnt about tables. This is written in an h2 tag. We learnt that they need to be properly ordered for accessibility reasons.</h2>
    <h3>This is an h3 tag and can't be above the first h2 tag on the page. It is bigger than the h2 tag because the css has made it 24pt</h3>

        I have left a comment in my code but you'll have to inspect my code to see what it says.

    <footer>
        Here's the info nobody reads that's usually quite helpful. Not many people get down into the footer. The css has made the footer background colour light pink.
